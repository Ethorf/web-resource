## What is the difference between soft delete and hard delete? Why would you want to do either or
- Soft delete: 
  - Flagging row as deleted (rather than actually deleting)
  - Advantages:
    - Have record of data for future analysis
    - Don't have to worry about cascading delete on other tables
  - Disadvantages:
    - Have to take flag into account when coding, which may lead to bugs
    - Decreased performance due to memory that 'deleted' rows would be taking
    - May have high maintainability costs depending on quantity and pace of deletions on platform
- Hard delete: 
  - Permanently removing row
  - Advantages:
    - Saves space (thus increasing computation speed)
    - Can easily set cascade deletes to remove related records
      - This would be easier to code around (i.e. you'd have less conditionals)
  - Disadvantages:
    - No record of deleted data
